A few rough tests to get started...

    test.html - qunit test cases for the {create,get,put}ImageData() canvas functions
    visual.html - a visual test that attempts to isolate any pixel format issues
                  that may arise when dealing with Flash (ARGB vs RGBA) and also
                  provides a very light but probably common use-case of all three
                  ImageData functions.

Worth noting:

    createImageData(ImageData) doesn't seem to be implemented on any browsers yet.

    Apart from that:

        * All qunit tests pass on Chrome 4.1.249.1045 (42898) (Windows)
        * All qunit tests pass on Chrome, Firefox 3.6 and Safari 4 (Mac) except for
          some of the out-of-bounds getImageData calls.
        * All tests pass visual.html

Todo:

    * Test putImageData's dirty* parameters
    * Probably other stuff
